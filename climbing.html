                <p>
                    Rock climbing is a sport that involves climbing both natural rock formations and artificial rock
                    wall - it has also been growing rapidly since being a niche sport in the 1980s. It is a physically
                    and mentally demanding activity that requires strength,
                    endurance, agility, and balance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have been climbing for over 20 years now, and it it a huge part of my life. I
                    enjoy the physical challenge and the mental focus required to climb difficult routes. Climbing has
                    also allowed me to explore beautiful natural landscapes and meet like-minded individuals. I first
                    climbing when I was in the scouts and I have been hooked ever since. I have climbed in many
                    different locations, including the UK, Spain, and the USA.
